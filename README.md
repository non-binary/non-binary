## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kara Graysen (but I'm still known as Luna in some circles). I'm a disabled non-binary person living in Montreal, Canada. I'm a senior iOS engineer with a specialization in CI/CD and mobile automation. I have been working in tech and, in that time, I've worked for multiple big names such as [CircleCI](https://circleci.com), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com) and [Bitrise](https://bitrise.io) among others.

My objective in life is to help people. Through my [blog posts](https://noisypigeon.blog), side projects and in my full-time job, my interest is most piqued when I'm working on something that will have an impact on people's lives. Now I'm working on: [Valora](https://valoraapp.com), a Venmo-*like* app for underserved communities and Pigeon Documents, a document editor that focuses on accessibility and providing a great experience for everyone.

## Some facts about me

I'm terrible at writing about myself but here we go! I used to be a core contributor on the [Quick](https://github.com/quick/quick) team (under a different name and handle) and I also ran support for the [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy) GitHub community. In 2014, I attended WWDC on scholarship and was featured in four different news publications (they're under my deadname so you'll just have to trust me). Before moving to Montreal, I lived in Vancouver then London then Berlin. I now live in the Plateau neighbourhood with my my partner [Milo](https://instagram.com/teawithbees) (who also was the one who made the illustrations btw!) and our calico kitty Herbie. Oh, and I strongly believe that pineapple belongs on pizza (but not with ham. Bacon is where it's at).

## Pigeon Documents

I am working on an app called Pigeon Documents which is going to be an aesthetically pleasing and powerful Markdown editor that includes collaboration and content publishing features with a heavy focus on accessibility. I am looking for help to fund this project as I only have $500/month to put towards this project and that is not enough to cover tool expenses _and_ hire great consultants to help me architect systems and make it a reality. Anything from $1, $10, $50, or more helps! All sponsors will get a Pro subscription to Pigeon Documents once launched in addition to other perks with the different tiers. Please consider [becoming a recurring GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/noisypigeon) or doing a one-time donation. Thank you!
