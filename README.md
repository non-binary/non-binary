### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Kara Graysen (but I'm known as Luna at work). I'm a non-binary person living in Montreal and I work at [cLabs](https://clabs.co) where I'm currently building our new CI/CD solution for [Valora](https://valoraapp.com). I spend my free time writing on my [blog](https://noisypigeon.blog) and drawing pigeons on my iPad.

Here are some noteworthy facts about myself:

- :euro: I used to work at [Bitrise](https://bitrise.io), [PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) and [Realm](https://realm.io).
- :dancer: I used to be a core contributor on the [Quick](https://github.com/quick/quick) team.
- :trumpet: I used to do volunteer support for the [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy) GitHub community.
- :books: I used to teach iOS development at [Lighthouse Labs](https://lighthouselabs.ca).
- :tickets: I attended WWDC 2014 on scholarship.
