### Hi there! :wave: I'm Kara Luna Graysen.

I'm a non-binary software engineer in Montr√©al, Canada. I do mobile automation for the [Valora wallet](https://github.com/celo-org/wallet) at [Celo Labs](https://clabs.co). I also work on [Pigeon Documents](https://pigeon.do) in my spare time.

### Pigeon Documents

Pigeon Documents is a *coo*-l text editor for iPadOS with GitHub Flavoured Markdown support.
